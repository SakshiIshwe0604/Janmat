🌍 2. Geo & Location-Based Features

Useful for real-world civic apps.

Map Integration (OpenStreetMap / Leaflet):

⚙️ 4. Backend & Workflow Features (Django)

Enhance admin and system efficiency.

Graphs showing issues per category, resolution rate, etc.

Assign Issues to Departments: Waste → Municipal Corp, Electricity → Power Board, etc.

Email/SMS Notifications: Notify user when their issue status changes.

Moderation System: Admin can review and approve public issues before publishing.

🔐 5. Authentication & Roles

🚀 8. Advanced / Future Goals

If you want to take it further:

Progress Timeline: Track an issue’s progress visually.

Mobile App Version (React Native / Flutter).

Gamification: Points or badges for active users.

Voice Issue Reporting: Record and upload a short description.

Admin AI Assistant: Summarize trends (e.g., “Most issues this week are road-related”).












PHASE 1 – Core Improvements (1–2 weeks)

Goal: Make Janmat clean, modern, and fully usable by the public.

🧩 1. Add Issue Status & Workflow

Backend (Django):

Add status field in Issue model (choices: Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed).

Add an endpoint to update status (PATCH /api/issues/<id>/status/).

Only allow admin/officer roles to update.

Frontend (React):

In IssueList.js, display colored badges for status:

🟢 Resolved

🟡 In Progress

🔴 Open

Allow admin to update status via dropdown or buttons.
😗️
👤 2. Profile Page for Logged-in User

Frontend:

Create a new page /profile.

Fetch user info from /api/user/ (Django can expose this using @api_view(['GET']) + request.user).

Show:

Username, email

Number of issues submitted

Table of their own issues (title, status, date)

Design:
A simple card-based layout with section headers like “Your Reported Issues”.

🔍 3. Search + Filter in Issue List

Frontend:

Add a search bar above the issue table.

Add filter dropdowns (category, status).

Use React state to dynamically filter issues client-side.

Design Tip:
A clean search input (🔎 Search issues...) and small dropdowns beside it will make the dashboard look like a real issue management portal.

💬 4. Upvote / Support Feature

Backend:

Add an integer field upvotes in the Issue model (default=0).

Create endpoint /api/issues/<id>/upvote/.

Frontend:

Add 👍 button next to each issue.

On click → axios.post('/api/issues/{id}/upvote/') → refresh list.

Design Tip:
Small thumbs-up icon next to issue titles makes it interactive.

🌍 PHASE 2 – Smart & Engaging Features (2–3 weeks)

Goal: Make Janmat intelligent, engaging, and more visual.

🗺️ 1. Map View Integration (Optional but Awesome)

Use Leaflet.js (lightweight, no API key required).

Each issue appears as a marker on OpenStreetMap.

Clicking marker shows a small popup with title, category, and status.

Design:
Button on top → “🗺️ View on Map”.

💡 2. Auto-Detect or Enter Location

Use browser Geolocation API → pre-fill location field in IssueForm.

Fallback: allow manual entry if permission denied.

📈 3. Admin Dashboard

New page /admin-dashboard.

Charts showing:

Issues by category (Pie chart)

Issues by status (Bar chart)

Resolved issues over time (Line chart)

Use simple libraries like Chart.js or Google Charts.

🧠 4. Basic AI / Smart Categorization (Optional)

In Django backend, before saving an issue:

Use keyword detection (e.g., if description includes “road”, set category=road).

Later, integrate a small ML model.

💬 PHASE 3 – Community & Enhancement (4–6 weeks)

Goal: Build transparency, communication, and engagement.

🧍‍♂️ 1. User Roles

Roles: Citizen, Official, Admin.

Officials can mark issues as resolved.

Admin can view reports.

🗨️ 2. Comments on Issues

Backend: Create Comment model (user, issue, text, timestamp).

Frontend: Add comment thread under each issue.

🏆 3. User Engagement System

Points for reporting issues.

Leaderboard: Top contributors of the week/month.

📱 4. Mobile Optimization

Add responsive layouts for IssueList & IssueForm.

Sticky navigation bar on small screens.

🎨 Design Recommendations

Keep the “modern civic” look:

White background, gray/light blue accents.

Status badges with subtle colors.

Rounded cards, hover shadows.

Font: Inter, Poppins, or Roboto.

Buttons: Minimal solid blue (for action) and gray (for secondary).
